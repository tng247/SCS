        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>December, 2017</p>
        <p>Thank you for purchasing <a href="https://americantrucksimulator.com">American Truck Simulator</a> and/or <a href="https://eurotrucksimulator2.com">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a>. This <code>readme</code> describes how to play custom internet radio streams and music files in the game.</p>
        <h3>How to add your favorite online radio to the game</h3>
        <p>Open the file <code>live_streams.sii</code> with your favorite text editor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows</strong>: <code>Documents\American Truck Simulator\live_streams.sii</code></li>
            <li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>.local/share/Euro\ Truck\ Simulator\ 2/live_streams.sii</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here you can add as many radio streams as you want following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the line below to the location hinted in the file, or just under the similar items:
            <br><br>
            <code>stream_data[]: "RADIO_URL|RADIO_NAME|GENRE|LANGUAGE|BITRATE"</code></li>
            <br>
            <li>Replace <code>RADIO_URL</code> with the URL address of the radio stream. Then replace <code>RADIO_NAME</code> with the name you want to see in the game, the same applies for <code>GENRE</code>, <code>LANGUAGE</code> and <code>BITRATE</code>. Remember to keep proper formatting, especially the <code>|</code> character that separates the radio URL from the name.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you are done, save the file and close it. Launch the game and open <strong>Radio</strong>. You should see the radio streams you just added on the list. Double-click one and it should start playing.</p>
        <h4>Example <code>live_streams.sii</code> file</h4>
        <pre>live_stream_def : .live_streams {
stream_data[]: "http://123.123.123.123:8000|My Favourite Radio|Rock|EN|128"
stream_data[]: "http://anotherradio.com/stream.mp3|Another Radio|Pop|RU|320"
}
        </pre>
        <h4>Supported streams</h4>
        <p>The game supports all MP3-type streams (except MMS). With proper codecs, which are often already installed, you can also listen to many other stream formats.</p>
        <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> This feature is currently unavailable on Linux and macOS.</em></p>

        <h3>How to add your favorite music to the game</h3>
        <p>Go to the <code>music</code> folder and create a shortcut to the folder with your favorite music files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows</strong>: <code>Documents\American Truck Simulator\music</code></li>
            <li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>.local/share/Euro\ Truck\ Simulator\ 2/music</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If all went well, you should be able to see the imported songs in the game on the <strong>Radio</strong> screen.</p>
        <p>The game can play MP3 files as well as other formats depending on the codecs installed on your computer.</p>
